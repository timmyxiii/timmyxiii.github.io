    <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Timmy Oyeniyi. I really love gaming. I am in 7th grade and I try my best to make my parents proud. I just want to say thank you to all the stemhub staff for giving me this opportunity to learn something new. I enjoyed everything and may the Lord bless you.</p>
     
    <h2 id="coding">Coding</h2>
    <p>During our coding we learned how to make a website using one compiler. Coding was really frustrating at times, but I am glad that I was able to learn something good.</p>
     
    <h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2>
    <p>Graphics was really fun. I enjoyed it a lot. I learned different things in graphics such as types of graphics, elements of graphic design, the essential elements of graphic design, principles of graphic design, and some of the fundamental principles of design.</p>

    <h2 id="robotics">Robotics</h2>
    <p>Robotics was fun too. I played around with codes with my mBot.</p>
